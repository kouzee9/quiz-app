lessons learned:
- abstracting repetitive code for repeat use
- bufferedWriter rewrite nature and the need for the true argument in constructor to amend file as opposed to overwriting it
- loose coupling - dependency injection into service class for repo variable - allows flexibility for testing
- learned how sharing specific resources (BufferedReader) across multiple methods can become inefficient for file reads
- variable scope for switch-case statement

note: all my projects are approached with the mentality of seeking desired difficulty. this means I mentally tax my own mind to try and solve the problem. only after a certain duration (maybe hours/days - depends really), if I still can't figure out a specific feature/problem, I will consult an LLM or online resources (official documentation is leveraged regardless).
